## Resume Idea

My idea for a virtual reality resume would be to have a person shoot a bow into different targets with touch controllers. 
The controllers would turn into a bow that someone could grab with one hand and aim and shoot with the other.

I would shoot different parts of my resume:

- Home
- About
- Social Media Contact
- Experiences
- Skills
- Fun todo

The scenery is a nice low-poly mountain range or grassy terrain landscape. I will have audio in as well that is royalty-free
and is very peaceful.

The UI would appear on translucent picture frames when you shoot the targets. Possibly there will be a mode where you can make the
targets more dynamic and move everywhere?
